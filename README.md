Good Morning Dan/Benson,

We are scraping a few sites for the business on External VPC since it will not be able to scrape using the internal VPC or Bright data proxy.

We need help getting a system that works like our personal laptop for developing and troubleshooting these sites. As we are having a hard time developing/troubleshooting using External VPC. 

We will be happy to schedule a meeting to provide detailed information.

Thanks,
Anil Kumar
